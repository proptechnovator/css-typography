# CSS Typography
Typography describes the creative design of the text on your web pages. This includes the font pairings, and the stylized aspects such as letter design,kerning and leading.

<br/>

## Properties
* font-size describes the size of the font
* font-family descirve the font of the element
Usually, we will set a base font-family for the entire project and change the font-family for headings so they look different, and stand out more. <br/>
<br/>

## Font-Stack, Generic Family
A font-stack is used in case the browser view the site or app does not support a particular font, so we provide varius font types in the font-family property values. <br/>
<br/>
Please note that the order of the font-stack matters. The browers will go through the list, in order listed, until it finds a supported font.
<br/>
<br/>
If none of those fonts are supported, the browser will use default standard fonts like serif, san-serif, cursive, fantase and monospace
<br/>
<br/>

## Google Fonts
These are external fonts that can be found at: 
<br/>
<br/>
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
<br/>
<br/>
Google fonts then has a filter to search by type, or properties that you are looking for to make it quick and easy to select.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that the more fonts you load, this will effect the load time and the site performance.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two ways to use the Google fonts. 
<br/>
<br/>
We can embed them as link element in the head tag of the index.hml file. 
<br/>
<br/>
The other is to import the fonts into the CSS file at the top before any customizes CSS styles being added. 
<br/>
<br/>
Simply reference the font-family you would like to use in the class styles you are setting up.
